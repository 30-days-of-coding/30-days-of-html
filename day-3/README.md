## Introduction

Welcome to Day 3 of "30 Days of HTML." Today, we'll explore the use of classes and IDs in HTML. These attributes are essential for applying styling and adding functionality to your HTML elements.

## Classes

Classes are used to group and style multiple HTML elements. You can define a class using the `class` attribute. Here's an example:

```html

<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph
.</p>
<style>
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: black;
    font-weight: bold;
}

</style>

```
