# 30 Days of HTML - Day 6: Tables and Lists

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 6 of "30 Days of HTML." Today, we'll explore the use of tables and lists in HTML. Tables are excellent for organizing data, and lists are useful for presenting information in a structured format.

## Tables in HTML

Tables in HTML are created using the `<table>` element. A table consists of rows (`<tr>`) and cells (`<td>`) for data. Here's a simple example:

```html
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cell 3</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

## Lists in HTML

There are 2 types of lists.

Unordered List (`<ul>`): This type of list is used for items that are not in a specific order. Bullets are commonly used to mark each item.

Ordered List (`<ol>`): This type of list represents items in a specific order, such as a numbered list.

Here is how to create a list
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```
